## Getting Started

This app relies on a python backend to handle data fetching from the data source. This backend can be found in the `backend` folder. A virtual python environment should be created using the requirements file provided and then used to run the backend.

After the python backend is running, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Note that when the server is first started up, pages may have to compile as this is a dev server. This will lead to a longer initial loading times.
